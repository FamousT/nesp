    <h4>
        Remarks by His Excellency, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, GCON, Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,
         on the Occasion of the Presentation of the Economic Sustainability Plan to His Excellency, President Muhammadu 
         Buhari, On 11th Of June, 2020 <br><br>
        Protocols
        </h4>
<p>
    Mr. President, in the very early days of the emergence of the COVID-19 crisis, you constituted a crisis committee headed by the Hon. Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning to look at what the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic might be on the budget and the economy.
    Subsequently, on the 30th of March, 2020, in response to the what was then becoming a threat of the most severe economic downturn in our Nation’s history, largely caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Your Excellency directed me to chair the Economic Sustainability Committee (ESC), with the following members:
</p>
<div class="col-md-8 mt-sm-30">
    <div class="">

    <li><span>Permanent Secretary in the Cabinet Office – Secretary.</span></li>
</ol>
    <p class="mt-3 text-black">In view of the envisaged scope of the engagement, we later co-opted the following Ministers with your permission:</p>

    <li><span>Hon. Minister of Transportation.</span></li>
    </ol>
    </div>
    </div>

    <p class="mt-3 text-black">Our Terms Of Reference were to:</p>

    <div class="col-md-12 mt-sm-30">
        <ol class="ordered-list-roman">
            <li><span>Develop a clear Economic Sustainability Plan in response to challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic;</span></li>
            <li><span>Propose monetary policy measures in support of the plan;</span></li>
            <li><span>Provide a Fiscal/Monetary Stimulus Package, including support to private businesses (with emphasis on strategic sectors most affected by the pandemic) and vulnerable segments of the population;</span></li>
            <li><span>Identify fiscal measures for enhancing distributable oil and gas revenue, increasing non-oil revenues and reducing non- essential spending, towards securing sufficient resources to fund the plan;</span></li>
            <li><span>Articulate specific measures to support the States and FCT;</span></li>

            <li><span> Identify measures that may require legislative support to deliver the Plan.;</span></li>
            </ol>
    </div>

    <p class="mt-3 text-black">We consulted and received Memoranda from:</p>
    

    
    <div class="col-md-12 mt-sm-30">
        <ol class="ordered-list-roman">
            <li><span>Members of the Presidential Economic Advisory Council.</span></li>

            <li><span>Leadership of the National Assembly.</span></li>
            </ol>
    </div>

    
    <p class="mt-3 text-black">We also took into account, existing government policies and strategies, including the following:</p>
    

    <div class="col-md-12 mt-sm-30 mb-5">
        <ol class="ordered-list-roman">
            <li><span>The Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP)</span></li>
            <li><span>Report of the Economic Crisis Committee (headed by the Hon. Minister of Finance, Budget & National Planning)</span></li>

            </ol>
    </div>

    <p class="text-black">
        Mr. President, the Economic Sustainability Committee was motivated by your directive to come up with a plan that would provide succor to Nigerians taking into account the dangers posed to the economy by the global economic slowdown, which also resulted in a drastic fall in crude oil production and prices, with serious implications for government revenues and foreign exchange earnings.<br>
        In addition, the inevitable mandatory lockdowns and social distancing measures put in place to curb the spread of COVID-19 also had a severe negative impact on farms and factories, as well as on trade, transport and tourism all over the world.<br>
        Several projections, including those done by the National Bureau of Statistics on behalf of the Economic Sustainability Committee, showed:
    </p>

    <div class="col-md-12 mt-sm-30 mb-5">
        <ol class="ordered-list-roman">
            <li><span> A severe downturn in our oil earnings, as a result of which, even with the oil price at 30 dollars a barrel, we would still have a shortfall of about N185 billion every month, in the amount available for allocation to the three tiers of Government;</span></li>
            <li><span>That unemployment may rise to 33.6% or about 39.4 million people by the end of 2020 if we fail to take prompt preemptive measures;</span></li>
            <li><span>That millions more will fall into extreme Poverty before the pandemic ends;</span></li>
            <li><span>That GDP may fall to between minus 4.40% and minus 8.91%, depending on the length of the lockdown period and strength of our economic response.</span></li>
            </ol>
    </div>
   

    <p class="text-black">
        So, we decided on a strategy hinged on Mr. President’s mantra to “produce what we eat and consume what we produce”. In other words, to create millions of new jobs, we need to focus on encouraging local production, local services, local innovation, and emphasize the use of local materials. Nigeria and Nigerians can produce our food, build our houses and construct our roads, using local materials in almost all cases. If we must import, it must be to support local production.
        We have therefore recommended that we must carry out mass programmes that create jobs and utilize local materials. Such will include:
    </p>

    <div class="col-md-12 mt-sm-30 mb-5">
        <ol class="ordered-list-roman">
            <li><span>Mass Agricultural Programme, which is expected to bring between 20,000 and 100,000 hectares of new farmland under cultivation in every State of the Federation and create millions of direct and indirect job opportunities.</span></li>
            <li><span>Extensive Public Works and Road Construction Programme focusing on both major and rural roads and using locally available materials like limestone, cement and granite.</span></li>
            <li><span> Mass Housing Programme to deliver up to 300,000 homes annually, engaging young professionals and artisans who form themselves into small and medium scale businesses within the construction industry, using indigenous labour and materials.</span></li>
            <li><span>Installation of Solar Home Systems, targeting about 5 million households with the collaboration of the private sector, serving about 25 million Nigerians who are currently not connected to the National Grid.</span></li>
            </ol>
    </div>

    <p class="text-black">
        We have also recommended support for local production and manufacturing of all that is possible, including technological applications, software, shoes, garments, steel fabrication, ceramics and furniture, with the required capital and essential machinery.
        We have also recommended the provision of ample support for the informal sector through low-interest loans and easing procedures for registration, licensing and obtaining permits. By these means, urban and informal business people like mechanics, tailors, artisans, and petty traders will be encouraged to improve and develop their services.
    </p>
    <p>
        Support for MSMEs, especially in assisting to restructure their loans with banks. Among others, this will assist businesses in the pharmaceutical, aviation, hotels and the hospitality industry, private schools, road transportation, technology companies, and the creative industry, amongst others.
        The Facilitation of broadband connectivity across the country and the creation of a wide variety of technology and ICT jobs.
    </p>
      
    <p>
        The Expansion of the Social Investment Programme, through an increase in the number cash transfer beneficiaries, increase in the number of N-Power volunteers and sundry traders enjoying small and microloans through the MarketMoni and TraderMoni schemes. Our recommendation is that the pre-existing conditional cash transfers should also be extended to cover a larger number of the extremely poor. Already the President had asked that one million recipients be added to the 2.6million currently on the register.
        The key to the success of this plan is undoubtedly ‘implementation’. We have therefore recommended that each Minister will be responsible for supervising the implementation of plans situated in their respective Ministries.
        Ministers will also be responsible for ensuring synergy between all relevant stakeholders across the public and private sectors.
    </p>
        <p>
        The Economic Sustainability Committee, which is inter-Ministerial in nature, should only then remain to oversee the plan implementation, ensure inter-ministerial coordination, and report regularly to the President, while expenditure is monitored through the National M&E framework and the Budget Office of the Federation.
        In conclusion, I wish to thank you, Mr. President, for the confidence reposed in members of the ESC by giving us this very critical national assignment.
        </p>
        <p>
        We are confident that if the proposals are taken as a whole and implemented conscientiously, Nigeria will avert the worst of the impending economic headwinds, and convert this crisis to a victory for the Nigerian economy.<br>
        Mr. President, may I now on behalf of members of the Economic Sustainability Committee, present this Plan, entitled “Bouncing Back: The Nigerian Economic Sustainability Plan” to Your Excellency for your kind consideration and approval. Thank you for listening.
    </p>
